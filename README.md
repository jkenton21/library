# library

This project is a simple library application. 

It has a form where you can fill in the information of a book (title, author, pages, etc.) and add it to your library. 

This library will be stored and listed on the website in cards displaying each book that has been added to the library.

The user will be able to delete books from the library as well as toggle the status of the books between read/unread.

Html and Css will be used for styling the page and JavaScript is used for the functionality of the site.
